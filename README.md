# System-Login-Supervision-System
The goal of my project is to replace the traditional handwritten login register process in a college laboratory with an efficient and automated digital system. This transition can offer several benefits, such as accuracy, time-saving, and easier data management. Using technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Java, and SQL.

//connect all the pieces of my project, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **HTML, CSS, JavaScript:**
   - Create the HTML pages for login (`login.html`) and registration (`register.html`).
   - Add the CSS styles in a file named `styles.css`.
   - Add the JavaScript code in a file named `script.js`.
   - Ensure that the form submissions and client-side validation are working as expected.

2. **Java Servlets:**
   - Create two Java servlets, `LoginServlet.java` and `RegisterServlet.java`
   - Set up your development environment with a Servlet container 'Apache Tomcat'.
   - Deploy your servlets on the server.

3. **SQL Database:**
   - Set up a database server 'MySQL'.
   - Create the necessary tables by running the SQL script provided in `CreateTable.sql` on your database.

4. **Database Connection in Java:**
   - Modify your servlets' database connection code to use the appropriate database credentials and connection URL.

5. **Wiring Everything Together:**
   - In your `LoginServlet.java`, connect to the database to validate user credentials during the login process.
   - In your `RegisterServlet.java`, connect to the database to store user registration data.
   - Make sure to handle exceptions, close database connections properly, and implement secure practices (e.g., hashing passwords).

6. **Deployment:**
   - Deploy your HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and image files on a web server.
   - Deploy your Java servlets on a Servlet container 'Apache Tomcat'.
   - Ensure that your servlets are correctly mapped in the `web.xml` configuration.

7. **Testing:**
   - Test your project by accessing the login and registration pages through a web browser.
   - Verify that user registration, login, and database operations are working as expected.

Remember, this is my experience. steps are slightly vary for your system configurations, software versions, and your coding styles.
